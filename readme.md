(This project uses [YOLOv8n]&#40;https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics&#41; and 
OpenCV to detect people in real-time from a webcam stream. Whenever a person is detected in the camera frame, 
the system prints `person detected` in the terminal.)

## Requirements

- ultralytics package
- opencv package 
- Ubuntu 18.04+ (other Linux distros may also work)
